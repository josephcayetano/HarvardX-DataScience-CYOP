### Chocolate Bar Rating Prediction â€“ HarvardX Data Science Capstone
- Cleaned and explored a dataset of about 1,700 chocolate bars to find patterns in ratings based on cocoa content, bean type, and origin
- Built and compared three machine learning models (SVM, KNN, Random Forest) to predict rating categories, with Random Forest performing best at ~72% accuracy
- Visualized trends by country, cocoa percentage, and bean type to give chocolate makers insights into what affects ratings
